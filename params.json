{"name":"Mails viewer","body":"#### MailsViewer ####\r\n\r\n   MailsViewer is a mails preview Engine which provides a table view for all mails under tmp/mails. So you can easily preview the mails\r\n   in non-production mode and no longer need to worry about accidentally sending a test email to someone elseâ€™s address.\r\n\r\n   MailsViewer is a fork of tomlion's [original code](https://github.com/tomlion/mails_viewer) and I'm glad to be\r\n   the maintainer; thanks go to him for getting this thing started!\r\n\r\n#### REQUIREMENT ####\r\n\r\n* MailsViewer should be used with Rails >= 3.1\r\n\r\n* In your config file, You should `require \"sprockets/railtie\" `if you don't `require 'rails/all'`\r\nand enable assets pipeline by adding `config.assets.enabled = true` to config file\r\n\r\n#### Usage ####\r\n\r\nAdd the gem to your Gemfile :\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ngem \"mails_viewer\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nSet ActionMailer's delivery method to :file :\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nconfig.action_mailer.delivery_method = :file\r\n```\r\n\r\nput this in your routes.rb:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nmount MailsViewer::Engine => '/delivered_mails'\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow just load up http://localhost:3000/delivered_mails\r\n\r\n##### Advanced #####\r\n\r\nYou can choose to send out some mails to the inbox instead of just\r\nstoring them in the file system by specifying which mails to sent:\r\n\r\n- `: send_if`          - Send mails that satisfy some condition\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nconfig.action_mailer.delivery_method = :file\r\nconfig.action_mailer.file_settings = {\r\n  location: 'tmp/mails',\r\n  smtp_settings: {\r\n    address:              \"localhost\",\r\n    port:                 25,\r\n    domain:               'localhost.localdomain',\r\n    user_name:            nil,\r\n    password:             nil,\r\n    authentication:       nil,\r\n    enable_starttls_auto: true\r\n  },\r\n  send_if: lambda { |mail| mail.destinations.select { |address| [\"yedingding@gmail.com\"].include?(address) }.any?\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow any mails sent to yedingding@gmail.com will not only store in the\r\nfilesystem for you to browse later, but also send out to his inbox.\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n-------\r\n\r\n![pragmatic.ly](https://pragmatic.ly/assets/vlogo.png)\r\n\r\nMailsViewer is maintained by [Pragmatic.ly](https://pragmatic.ly/ \"Pragmatic.ly\").\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to [tomlion](https://github.com/tomlion) for starting the project.\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2012 Dingding Ye, Pragmatic.ly (dingding@pragmatic.ly, https://pragmatic.ly/)\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
